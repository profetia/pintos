struct arg_elem 
  {
    char* arg;
    char* addr;
    struct list_elem elem;
  };

...

```

- `struct arg_elem`: A struct to store the argument and its address in the stack.
    - `arg`: The argument.
    - `addr`: The address of the argument in the stack.
    - `elem`: The list element.

#### ALGORITHMS 

> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing. How do
> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?
> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?

Arguments are parsed using `strtok_r()`, which is stored in a list. This list is then reversed and stored in the stack, guaranteeing the right order. Stack overflow is avoided by restricting the number of arguments.

#### RATIONALE 

> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?

`strtok_r()` is thread-safe, while `strtok()` is not.

> A4: In Pintos, the kernel separates commands into a executable name
> and arguments.  In Unix-like systems, the shell does this
> separation.  Identify at least two advantages of the Unix approach.

- The shell can do more complex parsing, such as parsing `|` and `>`.
- The shell can do more complex redirection, such as redirecting `stderr` to a file.

> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
> single process?

Open files are stored in a list in the thread struct. When a file is opened, a file descriptor is assigned to it. File descriptors are unique within a single process.

#### ALGORITHMS 

> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
> kernel.

Accessing user data from the kernel is done directly since interrupts does not change the page directory. Before accessing user data, the kernel checks whether the user pointer is valid using `pagedir_get_page()`. When the user pointer is invalid, the process is terminated.

For a system call that copies 4096 bytes of data, the  greatest number of inspections is 4096, since every byte of the page is inspected. The
least number of inspections is 2, as the bytes can at most be on 2 pages, which can be inspected by looking up the pages twice. For a system call that copies 2 bytes of data, the least number of inspections is 1 and the greatest number of inspections is 2. 

> B5: Briefly describe your implementation of the "wait" system call
> and how it interacts with process termination.

The `wait()` system call is implemented by using a semaphore. When a child process is created, a semaphore is initialized to 0. When the child process exits, the semaphore is upped. When the parent process calls `wait()`, it waits for the semaphore to be upped. When the child process is terminated, the semaphore is upped. If the child process is terminated before the parent process calls `wait()`, its exit status is stored in the child element and used directly when the parent process calls `wait()`.

Every byte of user memory is validated before it is accessed using `pagedir_get_page()`. When a bad pointer value is detected, the process is terminated. Validation is done before any other operations are done, so that no resources are allocated and need to be freed. Locks and buffers that are used is owned by the process, so they are freed when the process exits.

Example: When a system call to `read` is made, the system call code is validated and read from the user stack. Then the three arguments: the file descriptor, the buffer and the size is validated and read from the user stack. The buffer is then validated by its start and end address. The file descriptor is validated by checking if it is in the file list. 
Finally, the file is read from the file system and the number of bytes read is returned.

#### SYNCHRONIZATION 

> B7: The "exec" system call returns -1 if loading the new executable
> fails, so it cannot return before the new executable has completed
> loading.  How does your code ensure this?  How is the load
> success/failure status passed back to the thread that calls "exec"?

Before the new thread is created, the parent creates a `child_elem` and passes it to the child thread. After the child thread is created, the parent waits for the child to load the executable by waiting for the semaphore in the `child_elem` to be upped. When the child thread is done loading the executable, it upps the semaphore. If the executable fails to load, the child thread exits with status -1, setting the `pid` in the `child_elem` to `TID_ERROR`. When the parent thread is done waiting, it checks the `pid` in the `child_elem`. If the `pid` is `TID_ERROR`, the parent thread returns -1. Otherwise, the parent thread returns the `pid` of the child thread.

The exit status of the child process is stored in the `child_elem`, which is stored in the `child_list` owned by the parent. Either P waits C before or after it exits causes no race conditions as it only reads the exit status after the semaphore in `child_elem` is upped. And the semaphore is upped when C exits. When P terminates without waiting, the `child_list` is freed, which frees the `child_elem` and the semaphore. If P terminates before C exits, the `parent` pointer in C is set to NULL. The special case is when P and C exits at almost the same time, then the `parent_lock` is used to ensure that either C's exit status is stored in the `child_elem` or the `parent` pointer in C is set to NULL.

#### RATIONALE 

> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
> kernel in the way that you did?

Because it is simple and easy to implement, as it is already implemented in `pagedir_get_page()`.

> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
> for file descriptors?

Advantages: It is simple and easy to implement. It is also easy to understand and debug.
Disadvantages: It is not very efficient, as it requires a linear search through the file list to find the file descriptor.

> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

We did not change it.
